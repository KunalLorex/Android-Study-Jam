PDF SCANNER (cloning)

Problem Statement:

there ae many adds and subsciption faced by student and other workers just for scanning their documents and also they provide the watermark which is really insignificance , this type of activity loses effective communications in many meets.and also if we shre our hard copy there is chance of covid 

Proposed Solution :

This project proposes a “cam pdf scanner” to scan document whether it is hand written or not and changes to pdf so that we can be safe from hand contacting during this covid era thus through this one can not only submit assignent but also there can be clean and free envirenment and this is made so that your meeting can now be on next level

Functionality & Concepts used :

The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the worker to scan their docs and share where they want. 
Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for people to simply select their effective outcomes. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
LiveData & Room Database : we have connected to firebase though it is your mobile phone memory who will be handling it because it is your documents and we believe in you.
